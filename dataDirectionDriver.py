# as this data set grow I will likely want to reformat the data direction pattern and rules
# already I want to split mains and futures into their own files giving futures a datePredicted parent and Mains a DateOfPrediction parent

# will need a script to grab all files in data regardless of location and relocate them into a new schema

"""
Outline:
for all elements in data of type json -> move to new schema
if element = pattern 

Can I turn this into a CI thing make it embeded into an action call, 

okay Idea
we use a node server to create an api to interact with this dataset
Ive been wanting to make a node API anyway
I'd like to run this script as a simple github action 

I honestly dont want to make this in JS I stay an active JS hater and would rather eat rocks
